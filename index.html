<h4>This is my wife Melanie and our daughter Maya. I choose to make this assignment about my wife because she inspires me to be a better person every single day of my life. She truly is a great example of grit and greatness and I thank the lord for putting her in my life daily. Melanie grew up in western washington, in a navy town called Bremerton, WA. She tried her best to get good grades in high school, despite having troubling home issues, and eventually landed her way into a university. She has always beaten the odds against her, and I really admire her for that. In her fourth year at EWU, we ended up expecting our first child. Melanie was resilient and was faced with the challenge of giving birth to our daughter and graduating on time two months later with our new born baby. Well, she managed to do both and I could be more proud to call her my wife!      </h4>
